# Learn-Morse-Code
EN （中文說明請見下方）

This is a simple webpage for people who would like to learn Morse code in 21st.

Morse code is fun to play around with and can be more fun when you have friends who use it as well, however, memorizing Morse code is painstaking if learning it without using a proper method. In this webpage, I included a tree chart which makes memorizing Morse code easier as well as a functionality that allows you to click on the Morse codes to hear their sounds for enhancing memorization. Hope this helps.

HOW TO USE IT?
Very easy. 
Go ahead and download the zip file in the "Release" section. 
Unzip the zip file. 
Double click the "index.html".
ENJOY!

Since the app was written in HTML, it should be able to run on all the commonly seen operating systems as long as you have a usable browser... 

The audio files and the chart used in this webpage originated from http://www.learnmorsecode.com
